      <p>Hey! Hey! Hey!<br>
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as I sleep,
It's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even trust myself
It's killing me to see you this way <br>
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore <br>
Hey! Hey! Hey! <br>
There's an old voice in my head
That's holding me back
Well tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will all be over, and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right.
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear <br>
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Hey! <br>
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore <br>
You're gone, gone, gone away,
I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart,
there's nothing we can do,
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep <br>
Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!
Though the truth may vary
this ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say
Hey!
The screams all sound the same
Hey!
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
