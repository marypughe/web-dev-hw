I went to the University of Montana website.  It looked classy to me.  It has changed that their ate more options to chose from and it is more pixilated.
I love the GIT module.  I learned how to connect GIT hub with the desktop and with Atom.  I would love to learn how to delete or correct things when they don't work.  Seems that by the time I'm done with an assignment I could go back and do a much better job.
