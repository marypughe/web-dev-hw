  Hi my name is Mary.  Ok lets see if this works.  So I decided to take this class so I could build a web site for our roofing company.  I am majoring in business and would like to take in anything that would help me on that journey.  Now that I have started this class I have found that it entails a lot more than I thought it would, and I find that intriguing.  This class reminds me of my love of computers from about 15 20 years ago.  With the cd/ and dir and fsdsk commands... I never thought of the fact that.. well obviously that computer lingo still exists I am looking forward to this class but am at a complete loss for some of the info but your step by step instructions help a lot.
  Three things in my path of learning are.. the computer lingo and why the atom app is so important, how to use git hub more comfortably, and more about the internet and web all together...I have already learned so much about the connections and how it actually works.
