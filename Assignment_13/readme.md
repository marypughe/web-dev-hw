1.  Everything I learned was new to me in web development.  I learned a lot of information in such a short time,
    and I new knew how much work actually went into building a web page.
2.  Once again everything I learned about web design was all new. I did know things about color and fonts from
    my photoshop class, but I assumed it was pasting and clicking.  
3.  I thoroughly enjoyed this class and have developed a new love and major respect for coding.  I wish I would have          
    paid attention to the small detail about how to check your live sight while working on your repositories and before they were graded, I think  that would have made a huge difference for me and I would not have gotten so frustrated with my self towards the end when the pages weren't perfect, or working.
